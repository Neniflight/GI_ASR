# Genshin Impact Character Voice Model (ASR)
Model aiming to identify and differentiate Genshin Impact character voices, and be able to predict which Genshin character has the most similar voice to that in an uploaded file.

Key files:
- `playground_model.ipynb`: Model notebook to play around with and upload voice files to match with Genshin characters.
- `preprocessing.ipynb`
- `processing+nn.ipynb`: Feature extraction with Deep Neural Networks
- `processing_lr.ipynb`: Feature extraction with Logistic Regression
- `processing_lr.ipynb`: Feature extraction with MFCC's
